          <h3>Discourse on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
          <p>The term, <em>progressive enhancement</em>, refers to a paradigm shift in organizational systems from an engineering viewpoint to a content perspective in the web development industry.  Now considered a traditional method of web development, progressive enhancement focuses on the content being delivered by a website, rather than being concerned about engineering capabilities such as primary browser limitations.  This progressive enhancement paradigm shift is evident across multiple industries and products when one views various product development cycles in entrepreneurial organizations.  In general, the engineers first develop a product with which to enter the marketplace.  Once the product is established, the marketers seek to increase the technology base to be as applicable as possible in seeking interested viewers for revenue exploitation. </p>

          <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
          <p>This project has not gone well for me following a bad fall on November 5th, resulting in two compound ankle sprains and a deeply bruised knee.  
          On my first website attempt, I posted a bare outline of the project last week to have a baseline.  
          Knowing the first version website did not meet any expectations,I concentrated on building a revised website.</p>
          <p>My second version includes a link on the Home page to my horticulture website.  Originally, I put in a link to SpaceX Official Gear.  However, apparently external links to the site are not allowed.  My website inclusion is
          solely for purposes of demonstrating my ability to include external links.</p>
          <p>Overall, I found this exercise an excellent method of building my meager website skills.  The material is not difficult, but does require more of a time committment than I was able to provide the last six weeks for a truly robust website.  If I pass this course, I plan to take additional courses to further my knowledge and expertise.</p>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Wallace!</p>
