  <section id="About"><h1>Vestal Horticulture in Arkansas</h1>
  
<p>Joseph Wysong Vestal (1833-1917), a Quaker horticulturist, commenced one of the first 
U.S. mail order catalog businesses in 1861, offering a diverse range
of live plants, flowers, and seeds to a national market from Cambridge City, Indiana.  Seeking both a
warmer climate and more favorable shipping radius, as well as welcoming the abolition of slavery, Joseph
decided Little Rock was the ideal relocation choice for his thriving floral business.  Beginning in 1879, 
Vestal then became one of the largest greenhouse ranges and nursery operations in the U.S., shipping cut
flowers and plants nationwide for more than 100 years.</p>

<section id="First_Generation"><h2>First Generation - Joseph W Vestal (1833-1917)</h2>
<p>On October 7, 1880, the Arkansas Democrat
reported:
  <q>Mr. J.W. Vestal, of Cambridge City,
  Indiana...left for the north on last evening's
  train. He has put everything into shape and
  will be back shortly with his family, after
  which Arkansas instead of Indiana will be
  his home. This gentleman is one of the most
  extensive flower and bulb growers in the
  west. He has made shipments east to New
  York and west to Omaha, and sent car loads
  of flowers to Chicago and St. Louis. He comes
  to Arkansas on account of the mild winters,
  and at the same time has taken advantage of
  the low prices and bought an extensive tract
  of land for his gardens. Already two very large
  greenhouses have been erected, and by next
  summer Mr. Vestal intends that his gardens
  shall be to Little Rock what Shaw's is to St.
  Louis. His intentions are to have a good drive
  made in order that people from the city may
  find it a pleasant ride as well as beautiful
  sight. He has no doubt of his success in this
  enterprise, having already contracted for the
  delivery of a great many oar loads of plants.</q>
</p>  
<p>With the notation of "<strong>Re-Established at Little Rock,
1881</strong>," Joseph continued publication of the annual
catalog of "Select, New, Rare, and Beautiful Plants;
Roses."</p>

<p>Indicating the depth and diversity of all
plant offlerings, the 1890 catalog listed the following
number of varieties as well as specific descriptions of
each individual variety:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>ROSE PLANTS</em>: 59 premiurn varieties to 20
cents each and 49 general varieties at 10 cents
each for 108 total varieties.</li>
<li><em>GERANIUMS</em>: 48 varieties with single
petals; 27 varieties with double petals; 7
varieties "ivy-1eaved", and 5 varieties with
variegated leaves.</li>
<li><em>CHRYSANTHEMUMS</em>: 85 varieties.</li>
<li><em>STRAWBERRY PLANTS</em>: 182 varieties
with different colors, shapes, and sizes,
including orange and purple colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>For local sales, Joseph offered potato and vegetable
starts, grapes, fruits, berries, whole chickens and eggs,
seeds, and cut flowers. </p>

<section id="Second_Generation"><h2>Second Generation - Charles Vestal (1866-1928)</h2>
<p> Unlike his father Joseph, and older
brothers, George and Frank, with their combined
focus on horticulture, Charles specialized in business
operations, sales, and marketing. Charles took
immediate steps to upgrade the annual retail catalogs
and, in 1892, published the first known color catalog
west of the Mississippi River. Charles organized a
new much larger power plant for greenhouse heat and
built the first levees along the river to protect from floods, all in the early 1890s.</p> 

<p>According to the 1914 printing contract, Vestal &
Son were mailing at least 50,000 catalogs of 80 pages
each to worldwide customers.  By 1918, Charles had
increased the greenhouse acreage by four-fold.  The
highly stylized business letterhead proclaimed "We
employ no agents but sell to you direct by mail; Jos.
W. Vestal & Son; Growers, Importers and Dealers
in Roses, Bulbs, Plants, Evergreens, Seeds, Etc.;
Wholesale and Retail."</p>
</section>

<section id="Third_Generation"><h2>Third Generation - Charles H Vestal (1896-1954)</h2>
<p>Following the 1928 death of Charles Vestal, the
business changed from primarily supplying mail
order retail customers to supporting the regional
wholesale market of florists, nurseries, and other
retailers, under the third-generation leadership of
Charles Howell Vestal (1896-1954)</p>

<p>In 1928, "commercial greenhouse crops were
started, and the era of the wholesale florist began
to come about." The Depression was perhaps then
responsible for the first wholesale and retail business
losses since inception."  In 1932 the active list of retail
customers reached to 75,000. By 1935, it dropped to
15,000."</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Vestal gave a cheerful air to any company.
Always a smile lighted his face immediately
when he saw somebody he knew. His good
humor was contagious. He practically was
reared in the Vestal greenhouse. On his father's
death, he and his brother, Walter, took over
the business, and under their management the
oldest florist enterprise in Arkansas expanded
and flourished even more. They moved from
the retail into the wholesale trade, making the
firm known all over the United States. Once he
remarked of his business, 'You never get tired
of this work, because you are always striving
for perfection.' Continuous strivitig was
characteristic of him. He sought perfection
not for material reward but for the satisfaction 
of putting forth effort to make things better
tomorrow than they were today." Arkansas Gazette</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="Fourth_Generation"><h2>Fourth Generation - Kent G Vestal (1933-2006)</h2>
<p>After returning from Ohio State University in the
early 1950s, Kent Greer Vestai (1933-2006) joined
J.W. Vestal & Son as the upcoming fourth-generation
leader.</p> 

<p>The fourth-generation actors brought their own
preferred market directions, while facing new forms
of competition and an internal split of assets. With less
focus on developing plant genetics and the increased
use of proprietary cuttings of others such as Ecke and
Yoder, the greenhouse growing efforts began shifting
from flowering crops to the grow-out of seasonal pot
plants such as poinsettias, mums, and Easter lilies.  With the advent of air freight and the interstate
highway system, the Vestal wholesale florist business
expanded to include daily offerings of flower crops
grown in California and Colorado and a full range of
retail florist supplies to regional florists through Vestal
wholesale locations in North Little Rock, Fort Smith,
Texarkana, and Memphis.</p>

<section id="Fifth_Generation"><h2>Fifth Generation - Sarah A Vestal (1957-)</h2>
<p>In 2001, Sarah Anne Vestal developed, constructed, and
successfully operated the first U.S.D.A. certified
organic greenhouse range in the U.S., near Sheridan,
Arkansas, growing beefsteak tomatoes year round
for premium retailers such as Kroger's and Whole
Foods.</p>

<p>In 2014, Sarah was named as the national
cannabis expert for the Internal Revenue Service
due to her case work
in Northern California bringing cannabis growers into
compliance with federal taxation laws.  Moving back to Little Rock, Sarah was 
instrumental in the campaign for cannabis legalization in Arkansas and, in 2016, 
was named Woman Entrepreneur of the Year by The Arkansas Times for her efforts.</p>
